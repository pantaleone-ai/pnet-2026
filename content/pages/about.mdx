  ## Introduction
  I love building things that actually help people, and Android apps have been my favorite way to do that. For the last ten years, I’ve been working with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, creating apps that solve real problems and bring a little magic to everyday life.
  
  I live in Walnut Creek, California with my wife and daughter. I’m originally from Mongolia and studied Computer Science in Germany at the University of Mittweida. Thanks to that journey, I speak English, German, and Mongolian, and even a bit of Russian.

  ## Early Android Journey
  I still remember the old Android days with Java, XML, and Eclipse. After leaving my corporate job in 2011, I jumped straight into mobile development. By 2012, I had already launched my first two apps: a Local Marketplace App that helped neighbors buy and sell items, and a Custom T-shirt Design App featuring Mongolian designer collections. Those early projects set the foundation for everything I’ve built since.

  ## Modern Android Development
  In 2018, I returned to Android with a fresh mindset and the modern toolkit. I embraced Kotlin, Jetpack components, MVVM, Coroutines, Navigation, Room, and WorkManager. I published two more apps in 2019, and one of them was even featured on a well known Android YouTuber’s channel. That moment was a big boost and confirmed that my work was on the right track.

  ## Web Development
  You might wonder why an Android developer would jump into web development. The reason is simple. Great mobile apps need great backends, solid dashboards, and clean landing pages. So I explored Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. It turned out to be a lot of fun. I built two full stack Next.js apps that earned more than 450 GitHub stars and even some Vercel swag. My portfolio also got featured on WeAreDevelopers.com. Learning the whole stack has helped me become a better mobile developer overall.

  ## Today
  I’m still learning every day and building with the newest tools. Right now I work with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Room, Ktor, and Material 3. I’m focused on two projects that mean a lot to me.
Sign Language in Kotlin. An interactive app for learning Mongolian sign language.
RunMusic in Kotlin. A platform for runners to discover and share running playlists.
Both projects push me to think bigger and create experiences that connect with real people.
