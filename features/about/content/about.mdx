  ## Introduction
  I love designing and building things that help people. I am a Frontend Developer with over five years of experience, creating web and mobile apps with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I enjoy exploring new technologies and turning ideas into polished personal projects.
  
  I live in Walnut Creek, California with my wife and daughter. I’m originally from Mongolia and studied Computer Science in Germany at the University of Mittweida. I speak English, German, and Mongolian, and even a bit of Russian.

  ## How I got started
 After leaving my corporate job in 2011, I jumped into mobile development and launched two apps. One was a Local Marketplace App, and the other was a Custom T shirt Design App featuring Mongolian designers. Those early projects became the foundation for everything I have built since.

  ## Android Development
  In 2018, I began learning Kotlin, Jetpack components, and modern Android tools. I published two more apps, and one of them was featured on a well known Android YouTuber’s channel <Link href="https://youtu.be/OHo64fiWx2k?si=uJG6tzMkM80Nu94P&t=810">here</Link>. That recognition gave me a big boost.

  ## Web Development
  Great mobile apps need strong backends and clean landing pages, so I explored Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. I quickly fell in love with Next.js and TailwindCSS for their simplicity. I built two full stack Next.js apps that earned more than **450 GitHub stars** and received **official recognition for my open source contribution** in the form of <Link href="https://x.com/hiretimsf/status/1799500139662651526">Vercel Swag</Link> from former CTO <Link href="https://x.com/leerob">Lee Robinson</Link>.

  ## Today
  I discovered that I am much more suited to frontend development than Android development. My focus has shifted to Next.js and Tailwind CSS because I am far more productive with them. The workflow feels fun and flexible. I can build and ship fast, test ideas quickly, and reach users instantly without separate Android or iOS builds. I can prototype in hours instead of weeks and see real usage right away. I am currently learning and improving my skills by building personal projects.
