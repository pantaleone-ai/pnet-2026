  ## Introduction
  I love designing and building things that help people. I am a Design Engineer with over five years of experience, creating web and mobile apps with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I enjoy exploring new technologies and turning ideas into polished personal projects.
  
  I live in Walnut Creek, California with my wife and daughter. I’m originally from Mongolia and studied Computer Science in Germany at the University of Mittweida. I speak English, German, and Mongolian, and even a bit of Russian.

  ## How I got started
 After leaving my corporate job in 2011, I jumped into mobile development and launched two apps. One was a Local Marketplace App, and the other was a Custom T shirt Design App featuring Mongolian designers. Those early projects became the foundation for everything I have built since.

  ## Modern Android Development
  In 2018, I returned to Android with a fresh mindset and the modern toolkit. I embraced Kotlin, Jetpack components, MVVM, Coroutines, Navigation, Room, and WorkManager. I published two more apps in 2019, and one of them was even featured on a well known Android YouTuber’s channel. That moment was a big boost and confirmed that my work was on the right track.

  ## Web Development
  You might wonder why an Android developer would jump into web development. The reason is simple. Great mobile apps need great backends, solid dashboards, and clean landing pages. So I explored Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. It turned out to be a lot of fun. I built two full stack Next.js apps that earned more than 450 GitHub stars and even some Vercel swag. My portfolio also got featured on WeAreDevelopers.com. Learning the whole stack has helped me become a better mobile developer overall.

  ## Today
  I’m still learning every day and building with the newest tools. Right now I work with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Room, Ktor, and Material 3. I’m focused on two projects that mean a lot to me.
Sign Language in Kotlin. An interactive app for learning Mongolian sign language.
RunMusic in Kotlin. A platform for runners to discover and share running playlists.
Both projects push me to think bigger and create experiences that connect with real people.
