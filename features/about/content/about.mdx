  ## Introduction
  I love designing and building things that help people. I am a Design Engineer with over five years of experience, creating web and mobile apps with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I enjoy exploring new technologies and turning ideas into polished personal projects.
  
  I live in Walnut Creek, California with my wife and daughter. I’m originally from Mongolia and studied Computer Science in Germany at the University of Mittweida. I speak English, German, and Mongolian, and even a bit of Russian.

  ## How I got started
 After leaving my corporate job in 2011, I jumped into mobile development and launched two apps. One was a Local Marketplace App, and the other was a Custom T shirt Design App featuring Mongolian designers. Those early projects became the foundation for everything I have built since.

  ## Android Development
  In 2018, I began learning Kotlin, Jetpack components, and modern Android tools. I published two more apps, and one of them was featured on a well known Android YouTuber’s channel [here](https://youtu.be/OHo64fiWx2k?si=uJG6tzMkM80Nu94P&t=810). That recognition gave me a big boost.

  ## Web Development
  Great mobile apps need strong backends and clean landing pages, so I explored Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. I quickly fell in love with Next.js and TailwindCSS for their simplicity. I built two full stack Next.js apps that earned more than **450 GitHub stars** and received **official recognition for my open source contribution** in the form of [Vercel Swag](https://x.com/hiretimsf/status/1799500139662651526) from former CTO [Lee Robinson](https://x.com/leerob). My portfolio was also featured on [WeAreDevelopers.com](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/en/magazine/561/web-developer-portfolio-inspiration-and-examples-march-2025-561).

  ## Today
  I’m still learning every day and building with the newest tools. Right now I work with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Room, Ktor, and Material 3. I’m focused on two projects that mean a lot to me.
Sign Language in Kotlin. An interactive app for learning Mongolian sign language.
RunMusic in Kotlin. A platform for runners to discover and share running playlists.
Both projects push me to think bigger and create experiences that connect with real people.
